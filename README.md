# Introduction
This repo contains codes and documentations for the project on "EEG intent classification" done while Interning at Luleå Tekniska Universitet.

# Structure

The Project has been forked from [Kearlay/research](https://github.com/Kearlay/research), we modified and applied LSTM on EEG streams represented as images.

Data analysis as Karpathy suggested [here](http://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/) to better understand data and dataset.

We finally discovered that the original code was 🐛 buggy 🐛, and we resolve the issue reaching lower accuracy, but fairly. The bug was, in fact, in the splitting procedure.
